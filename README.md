## Section Branches

Each course section has a different branch in this repository. Assignments are the same between all branches including main, but labs may be different. 

We reccomend `switch`ing to your sections's branch after cloning the repository. 

```
git switch 9am
```

or

```
git switch 12pm
```

and then you can simply use `git pull` each class section to stay up to date with labs and assignments.
